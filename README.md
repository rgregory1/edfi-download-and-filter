This program:

* Downloads files from the 2026 folder on the EFT Server
* Creates a new folder called checks with the date in the name
* Copies all the files from checks folder while filtering out the file names in exclusions.txt
* When the program is finished, it opens the new checks folder
* All the while giving you audio cues as to what part of the process it's working on


Turn on the volume to hear the audio cues.
